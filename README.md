## Introduction
SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol widely used in embedded systems for fast and reliable data exchange. This project implements and verifies the SPI protocol in Verilog, featuring a state machine to handle `idle`, `send`, and `complete` states.

The verification environment is written in Verilog and includes a testbench that simulates realistic use cases, ensuring the design's correctness.

## Features
- **SPI Design**: Implements an SPI protocol with configurable data width (12 bits in this implementation).
- **Clock Generation**: Supports internal clock generation for SPI communication.
- **State Machine**: Handles different states (`idle`, `send`, and `complete`) effectively.
- **Testbench**: Provides stimulus and monitors SPI functionality during simulation.
